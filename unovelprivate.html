        <br>

        </b>
        consist of comments or content that you post to the Unovel Services
        and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content,
        which may include a name, user name, comments, likes, status, profile information
        and picture. Public Information and Posts are always public, which means
        they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on
        external search engines.
        <br>
        <b>
          Information from Social Media.
        </b>
        If you access or login to a Unovel Service through a social media
        service or connect a Unovel Service to a social media service, the
        information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated
        with that social media service, any information or content you have permitted
        the social media service to share with us, such as your profile picture,
        email address or friends lists, and any information you have made public
        in connection with that social media service. When you access the Unovel
        Services through social media services or when you connect a Unovel
        Service to social media services, you are authorizing Unovel to collect,
        store, and use such information and content in accordance with this Privacy
        Policy.
        <br>
        <b>
          Activity Information.
        </b>
        When you access and interact with the Unovel Services, we may collect
        certain information about those visits. For example, in order to permit
        your connection to the Unovel Services, our servers receive and record
        information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially
        your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information.
        If you access the Unovel Services from a mobile or other device, we
        may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geolocation
        data, or other transactional information for that device.
        <br>
        Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels,
        beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies) are comprised of
        small bits of data that often include a de-identified or anonymous unique
        identifier. Websites, apps and other services send this data to your browser
        when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer
        so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests
        for pages from that service. These technologies may also be used to collect
        and store information about your usage of the Unovel Services, such
        as pages you have visited, content you have viewed, search queries you
        have run and advertisements you have seen. Third parties that support the
        Unovel Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such
        as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate Unovel Services
        usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information.
        Unovel does not control these third-party technologies and their use
        is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies.
        Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your
        settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block
        cookies altogether. Please consult the 'Help' section of your browser for
        more information.

        <b>

        sources, such as publicly available information from social media services,
        commercially available sources and information from our Unovel Affiliates
        or business partners.

        <br>

        Be aware that any personal information that you choose to share in public

        If your personal information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update
        it quickly or to remove it â€” unless we are required to retain that information
        for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal
        information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on
        your request.

      <p>
        Your personal information is important to you, and protecting that information
        is important to us. We take reasonable measures to protect our users from
