            9. Limitation of Liability
          </p>
          <p class="article" data-v-b6fd7b66>
            9.1 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, HUUUA
            shall not be liable to you for any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
            consequential, exemplary, extra-contractual, or punitive damages of any
            kind whatsoever, which are in any way related to the Platform or these
            Terms, regardless of legal theory (including, without limitation, contract,
            tort, personal injury, property damage, negligence, warranty, or strict
            liability), whether or not HUUUA has been advised of the possibility
            or probability of such damages, and even if the remedies otherwise available
            fail of their essential purposes. If you are dissatisfied with the Platform,
            or with any of these Terms, or feel HUUUA has breached these Terms,
            your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue using the Platform. This
            limitation of liability is part of the basis of the bargain between us.
          </p>
          <p class="article" data-v-b6fd7b66>
            9.2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if any part of this
            limitation of liability is found to be invalid or unenforceable for any
            reason, HUUUA’s agreement liability arising out of breach of this Terms
            and/or your use of the Platform will not exceed, in the agreement amount
            for all claims, five hundred dollars ($500.00 USD).
          </p>
          <p class="article" data-v-b6fd7b66>
            10. Indemnification
          </p>
          <p class="article" data-v-b6fd7b66>
            10.1 You are responsible for your use of the Platform, and you will defend
            and indemnify HUUUA and its officers, directors, employees, consultants,
            affiliates, subsidiaries and agents (together, the “HUUUA Entities”)
            from and against every claim, liability, damage, loss, and expense, including
            reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected
            with: (a) your access to, use of, or alleged use of, the Platform; (b)
            your violation of any portion of these Terms, any representation, warranty,
            or agreement referenced in these Terms, or any applicable law or regulation;
            (c) your violation of any third-party right, including any intellectual
            property right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy
            right; or (d) any dispute or issue between you and any third party. We
            reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense
            and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (without
            limiting your indemnification obligations with respect to that matter),
            and in that case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of that claim.
          </p>
          <p class="article" data-v-b6fd7b66>
            10.2 HUUUA reserves the right to take over the exclusive defense of
            Claims for which HUUUA is entitled to indemnification, and in such
            event, you shall provide prompt and reasonable cooperation to HUUUA
            at your own expense.

            11. Promotions
          </p>
          <p class="article" data-v-b6fd7b66>
            In addition to these Terms, a Promotion made available by HUUUA through
            the Platform, or otherwise may have specific rules that are different from
            these Terms. By participating in a Promotion, you agree to and will become
            subject to those additional terms and conditions, which will be provided
            to you when a Promotion is offered. HUUUA urges you to review all rules
            before you participate in any Promotion. The rules of a specific Promotion
            will take priority over these Terms in the event of any conflict of the
            language with a given Promotion.

            owner, its agent, or the law; and

            12.2 Any notice or counter-notice you submit pursuant to the foregoing
            must be truthful and must be submitted under penalty of perjury. A false
            notice or counter-notice may give rise to personal liability. You may therefore
            want to seek the advice of legal counsel before submitting a notice or
            a counter-notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated herein,
            please note that whether or not HUUUA disables access to or removes
            any materials pursuant to the foregoing, HUUUA may disclose your identity
            to any third party who has alleged a violation of intellectual property
            rights hereunder, or supplied us with a counter-notice, as well as disclose
            the contents of any notice of counter-notice. You acknowledge and agree
            that any disclosures by us pursuant to the foregoing shall not violate
            any of your rights, including, without limitation, any rights of privacy
            that you may have.

            tort, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless
            if the claims arise during or after the termination of the Terms) will

            by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (”SIAC”) under the Administrative
            Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre in
